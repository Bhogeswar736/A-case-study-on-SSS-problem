# A-case-study-on-SSS-problem

Pneumonia is a complex disease with a multitude of factors influencing its development and progression. Analyzing Pneumonia data can be challenging due to the high dimensionality and noise present in the data. This study presents a methodology for identifying hidden patterns in chest X-ray images of pneumonia patients using Fisherface technique, which combines principal component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) i.e pca+lda technique(Fisherface technique), as well as the Random Forest algorithm. The SSS (small sample size) problem is a well-known issue that can arise when using LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis) for data analysis. This problem occurs when the number of variables (features) in the data is larger than the number of samples, leading to a situation where the covariance matrix cannot be estimated reliably PCA is used to reduce the dimensionality of the chest X-ray images by identifying the most relevant features, while LDA is used to further enhance the separation between classes. The Random Forest classification algorithm is then used to classify the chest X-ray images based on the extracted features.
